		<h2>About</h2>

		<p>Matrix Sans is set of pixelated, retro-style fonts based on the classic 5&times;7 dot matrix capitals. The design captures the look of this ubiquitous format, incorporating the best features from historical examples. While its forebears are strictly utilitarian and technologically restricted, Matrix Sans is intended to be a useful, modern, display font family. There are six variants available:</p>

		<p><span class="big">Regular</span> is like most &ldquo;pixel&rdquo; fonts that use connected, square dots, like the displays of 8-bit home computers and video game consoles from the 1980s.</p>
		<p><span class="print big">Print</span> is made up of separate circular dots, resembling the output of a dot-matrix printer or the expiry dates on food products. It also mimics the electronic signs found on motorways, at airports and train stations, etc.</p>
		<p><span class="raster big">Raster</span> consists of horizontal lines with rounded edges, emulating a raster (the set of lines traced out by the electron beam in a CRT, as seen in old computer monitors).</p>
		<p><span class="screen big">Screen</span> is similar to Print, but uses square dots instead of round ones. It matches the look of the "character LCDs" seen in many devices, as well as some light-up LED displays.</p>
		<p><span class="video big">Video</span> is an interpolated version of Regular. It resembles the on-screen displays of VCRs, Teletext, camcorders and the like; harking back to the early days of computerisation in television and home video.</p>
		<p><span class="smooth big">Smooth</span> is also interpolated, but with perfectly smooth diagonals instead of the jagged steps seen in the other styles.</p>

		<p>The fonts were created by drawing the Regular glyphs as bitmaps, then turning them into outlines in FontForge with the help of a custom Python script. This method made it convenient to provide multiple variants with different styles of dots, allowing for faithful renditions of the various real-world examples of dot-matrix fonts.</p>

		<p>On screen, the Regular, Smooth and Video styles look best at multiples of 15-point size, where their outlines exactly align with screen pixels. The fonts are deliberately unhinted, to prevent them from appearing uneven at other sizes.</p>

		<h2>Features</h2>

		<p>The Matrix Sans fonts support hundreds of languages written with the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Georgian and Armenian alphabets. For a full showcase of the supported characters, see the <a href="tests.html">Tests & Demos</a> page.</p>

		<p>The fonts implement the OpenType &ldquo;Small Capitals&rdquo; and &ldquo;Small Capitals from Capitals&rdquo; features (except for Georgian scripts). Each style has an accompanying &ldquo;SC&rdquo; variant with small capitals in place of the regular lowercase.</p>
