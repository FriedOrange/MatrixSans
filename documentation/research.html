<h2>Research</h2>

<p>Much of my interest in the topic was piqued by Damien Guard‚Äôs article, <a href="https://damieng.com/blog/2011/02/20/typography-in-8-bits-system-fonts">Typography in 8 bits: system fonts</a>. In preparation for this project, I decided to conduct an even more comprehensive study of classic dot-matrix fonts, with a focus on those using the iconic 5&times;7 dot matrix capitals. In the end, over 40 existing 5&times;7 font designs were studied.</p>

<p>These example fonts are presented in approximate chronological order, ranging from the 1960s to the present day. This list is by no means exhaustive; it simply contains all the examples I could find.</p>

<p>Many of the fonts depicted below contained a full set of 128 or 256 characters, including special glyphs for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigraphics">pseudo-graphics</a> applications, other scripts, etc. So as to compare the glyph designs themselves rather than the character sets, only the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> ranges of each font are reproduced here (equivalent to Unicode's <a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf">Basic Latin</a> block). The original systems employed character cells of various sizes, resulting in different spacing between characters and lines. For clarity and consistency, the fonts have been presented here with 7&times;10 dot character cells.</p>

<p>I have arranged my comments on the fonts in PMI format: <u>Plus</u> (pros), <u>Minus</u> (cons) and <u>Interesting</u>. The earlier examples tend to attract more comments not necessarily because they are more idiosyncratic, but because each particular quirk is mentioned here only once. Much more could be written about each font if they were critiqued individually.</p>

<h3>IBM 029 Card Punch</h3>
<img src="research/IBM029.png" alt="IBM 029 character set">
<p><i>Reference: <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/misc/card-punch-typography/">Norbert Landsteiner &mdash; Punched Card Typography Explained</a></i></p>
<p><i>Font replicating this design: <a href="http://scruss.com/blog/2017/03/21/keypunch029-for-all-your-punched-card-font-needs/">Keypunch029</a> by Stewart C. Russell</i></p>

<p>The IBM 029, a machine for creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">punched cards</a>, was introduced in 1964 to replace the 026 Printing Card Punch from 1949. I decided to show the 029 character set here because it could print a few more characters than the 026. They are the two oldest dot-matrix character sets I have found in my research. They are so old, in fact, that the patterns were stored on a metal &ldquo;code plate&rdquo; since electronic read-only memories &mdash; indeed, integrated circuits (or silicon chips) in general &mdash; were yet to be invented.</p>
<p>Despite their advanced age, a majority of these glyphs have stood the test of time, appearing the same as newer 5&times;7 dot matrix fonts. There are only a couple of truly unusual designs, like the letter <u>S</u> which was probably chosen to differentiate it from the number <u>5</u>.</p>

<p><i>Reference: <a href="https://archive.org/details/ERIC_ED031274/page/n101/mode/2up">Paul Allen King Jr. &mdash; A novel solid state character generator</a></i></p>

<p>While searching <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> for information, I found a 1969 thesis about the development of a character generator for an automated library system at MIT. This device supplied character patterns for a computerised video display, still quite a novel concept at the time. The dot matrix data were stored in a hand-woven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_rope_memory">core rope memory</a>.</p>
<p>The character set depicted here was actually not intended to be used directly, but instead with interpolation circuitry that smoothed curves and diagonals to produce a 9&times;13 dot matrix. As such, many of the designs are unconventional or suboptimal in appearance in their 5&times;7 form.</p>

<p>The TMS4103 was an early <a href="https://www.tinaja.com/glib/rad_elec/mos_character_gens_6_74.pdf">MOS character generator</a>: that is, a special ROM chip containing character bitmaps. These devices were standard parts stocked by their manufacturers, without the need for a custom order as with ROMs in general. The TMS4103 dates back to at least 1970, when it was used in the first dot-matrix printers, the Centronics 101 and DEC LA30 DECwriter (well, I <u>assume</u> it was also used in the 101, since its character set is identical to <a href="https://manx-docs.org/mirror/vt100.net/docs/dec-00-la30-dc.pdf">that of the LA30</a>).</p>

<h3>National Semiconductor MM4240</h3>

<p>This is a composite of two character sets: those of the MM4240AA (capitals only) and MM4240AE (small letters only) character generators. Like most such devices from the era, the glyphs are strictly confined to the 5&times;7 dot matrix, forcing the descending letters <u>g j p q y</u> to sit high on the baseline.  The designs of the small letters appear to have been influenced by traditional handwriting; note especially <u>a b d e g l p q y</u>.</p>
<p>Apart from the slash <u>/</u> and <u>7</u>, all the characters up to <u>Z</u> are identical to those of the IBM 029. There seems to have been a trend of including a crosshatch graphic in the 0x7F position, also seen in several of the character sets below. This could serve as a blinking cursor on video displays.</p>

They are likely derivatives of each other, with differences probably due to errors in manual transcription. Shown here is the A00 ROM, which provides the option of true descenders (and very deep ones too, at 3 dots below the baseline).</p>

<p>This font, aptly named Terminal, is used when a Command Prompt window is set to use the 6&times;8 raster font (those being the full character cell dimensions, including the gaps around the 5&times;7 glyphs).

<p>This open-source font by Rebecca G. Bettencourt was created for the stated purposes of coding and plain text editing, and has a wide Unicode coverage with support for some constructed scripts in the Unicode Private Use Area. Similarly to the font I wish to create, it is distributed as an outline font in TrueType format, having been converted from bitmaps using <a href="https://github.com/kreativekorp/bitsnpicas">custom software</a>.</p>
<p>Fairfax has the best lower-case <u>b d g p q</u> that I have seen in any 5&times;7 font. It is the only design examined here that has the conventional bowl shapes for these letters (see the National Semiconductor MM4240 section above). While still being restricted to 5 dots of width, some glyphs enjoy a much taller dot matrix, such as the quotation marks, slashes and brackets. This affords the font a more modern feel, unlike anything derived from one of the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; 5&times;7 fonts above.</p>

<h3>Minecraft</h3>
<img src="research/Minecraft.png" alt="Minecraft character set">
<p><i>Reference: ascii.png (game texture file)</i></p>

<p>Although this is by far the most stylised font shown here, I felt it was worth examining since it belongs to the best-selling video game of all time; countless words in this font have been read by hundreds of millions of people around the world. This makes it a significant design with wide recognition, especially amongst young people.</p>
<p>In monospaced fonts like those above (except PixelMix), it was normal to include serifs on <u>1 I i l</u> for extra width. The Minecraft font is proportionally spaced, however, so many glyphs are much wider or narrower than usual. Additionally, the proportions of many glyphs (like the small punctuation marks, small raised asterisk, full-height slashes, etc.) are unusual for 5&times;7 dot matrix fonts, but perfectly normal for conventional typefaces. These features all help to give the Minecraft font a more contemporary feel.</p>

<p>There has long been more to computer fonts than the 95 printable ASCII characters. Some of the fonts examined above contained accented letters and other special characters, which we will now explore further. Where necessary, I have rearranged the glyphs to match the order of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1">ISO&#x2011;8859&#x2011;1</a> (and thereby Unicode's <a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf">Latin&#x2011;1 Supplement</a> block) to make comparison easier.</strong></p>
<p>See how the diacritical marks are very large, compared to conventional typefaces, owing to the number of dots required to define them.</p>

<h2 id="my-past-designs">My past designs</h2>

<p>I created my first dot-matrix font in 2013, using pencil and graph paper. I then scanned and digitised it with the help of Microsoft Paint. Ever since then, tinkering with such designs has been an occasional pastime for me. Initially, I did this with relatively little outside inspiration, but over time my work lost some originality in favour of more conventional (and usually better) design choices. Most were not based on 5&times;7 dot matrices, but below are four selected designs that were.</p>
<p>There is little to say about these designs that hasn&rsquo;t already been mentioned above, but I will note some of the more interesting features:</p>

<h3>Untitled, 2014</h3>
<img src="research/mine1.png" alt="My past design No. 1">
<p>This was one of my earliest efforts, based on the 7&times;7 font I created first. The long ascenders and descenders, number <u>1</u>, capital letters <u>A I S V Y</u> and small <u>j</u> are all unusual designs. The small letters almost have the traditionally correct shapes, if not for <u>d</u>.</p>

<h3>Untitled, 2014</h3>
<img src="research/mine2.png" alt="My past design No. 2">

<p>This is an improved version of the previous design, now based on smaller character cells. Here, I had arrived upon my favourite design of the slashes <u>/ \</u>, which admittedly doesn&rsquo;t work very well in the per cent sign <u>%</u>. There is also a unique design for the capital <u>G</u> and the rare variant of <u>R</u>, which I must have created independently. I remember adding the extra curves to <u>S</u> after seeing other examples and realising my previous effort was rather unusual.</p>

<h3>Untitled, 2018</h3>
<img src="research/mine3.png" alt="My past design No. 3">

<p>This design was created from scratch, without reference to any previous efforts. All the alphanumeric characters here are strictly 5 dots wide, including <u>1 I i j l</u>. We can see the introduction of my favourite design for the question mark <u>?</u>, and the capital <u>Y</u> no longer resembles <u>V</u>.</p>

<h3>QS Matrix 1.0, 2019</h3>
<img src="research/mine4.png" alt="My past design No. 4">

<p><a href="http://friedorange.xyz/quikscript/myfonts/QSMatrix.zip">This design</a> was created primarily as a font for the Quikscript and Shavian alphabets, hence the name QS Matrix. The design may have been based on the previous one, as it shares many similarities. The small <u>y</u> is unusual, and was inspired by the one from the Commodore MPS-803 printer as seen above.</p>
<p><a href="http://friedorange.xyz/quikscript/myfonts.html">Version 2</a> of this font was made after beginning the study documented here. As a result, I decided to alter some glyphs to make the font appear a little more generic.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="honourable-mentions">Honourable mentions</h2>

<p>I only discovered the following examples <em>after</em> this study was complete and all key glyphs for Matrix Sans were already designed. Nevertheless, in the interests of completeness, here are all of the remaining 5&times;7 dot matrix fonts that I have found (excluding most modern designs that can be found on websites such as FontStruct, as they are high in quantity and low in  quality). Most of them still have many unique and unusual features:</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>I attempted strike a balance between four principles when designing my own 5&times;7 font:</p>
<ul>
	<li>authenticity</li>
	<li>quirkiness</li>
	<li>consistency</li>
	<li>sound design</li>
</ul>
<p>The former two qualities are often in conflict with the latter two; for example, the crossbar of small <u>f</u> should ideally be at the waistline, but almost never is in the fonts seen above. Here, I would make the crossbar lower in the interests of authenticity. Doing so also adds a degree of quirkiness, which I think is desirable in such a font.</p>

<p>Of course, there is really a fifth, hidden criterion for choosing these designs: personal taste. Despite attempts to remain impartial, some of my preferences &#x2014; even dating back to my earliest, inexperienced designs &#x2014; have sneaked into this project. Most notable are the rare less-than and greater-than signs <u> &lt; &gt;</u> and question mark <u>?</u>, and the (possibly) unique small <u>m</u>. To be fair, these instances can actually be justified under the sound design principle, as sometimes the most common variant seen above just isn&rsquo;t very good (in my opinion). But perhaps it is only right that I do leave some kind of mark here, rather than creating the most generic design possible.</p>

<p>So, after seeing a dizzying array of 5&times;7 dot matrix fonts from past and present, it is finally time to design my new font. I consider the following glyphs to be easy choices, because the overwhelming majority of existing fonts use them or because they have no reasonable alternatives:</p>

<figure class="font" style="max-width: 768px;">
	<img src="research/options/easychoices.png" alt="Glyphs with easy design choices">
</figure>

<p>While this image only spans the range of the ISO&#x2011;8859&#x2011;1 character set, I plan for the font to support both <a href="https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/adobe-latin-charsets">Adobe Latin 4</a> and <del><a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/glyphsets/tree/main/Lib/glyphsets/encodings/GF%20Glyph%20Sets">Google Fonts Latin Expert</a></del> <del><a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/glyphsets/tree/main/GF_glyphsets/Latin">Google Fonts Latin Level 4</a></del> <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/glyphsets/blob/main/GLYPHSETS.md">Google Fonts Latin Core-Vietnamese-Plus</a>, which have much wider Unicode coverage. Also note that I have had to extend the character cells to 7 dots wide in order to fit the vulgar fractions <u>¬º ¬Ω ¬æ</u>, and the copyright and registered trademark symbols &copy; &reg;, which require 6 dots of width. It is possible to make those fractions only 5 dots wide, as in the Mullard SAA5050 seen above, but that scheme would not work for the others like <u>‚Öî ‚Öú ‚Öù ‚Öû</u>.</p>

<p>To fill in the gaps of the above figure, I judged which option would best suit my intended aesthetic for the font, based on the four principles mentioned at the start of this section and visual trials of different variations. I consider many of these options to be equally good. In fact, in some cases my real personal preference ended up as the second choice, since I ultimately decided a different option was more suitable for the font as a whole. The following table lists the glyphs I chose from, in decreasing order of preference (<u>i.e.</u> with my final decision leftmost):</p>

<table class="padded">
<tr>
	<th>Options</th>
	<th>Rationale</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/asterisk.png"></td>
	<td>Option 2 is too big, so much so that it might confuse contemporary audiences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/semicolon.png"></td>
	<td>Tests proved the bold punctuation marks don&rsquo;t suit the font as a whole. This choice also applies to others like the comma, colon, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/-.png"></td>
	<td>The 3-dot hyphen suits texts better and the 5-dot variant makes a better minus sign. Since this Unicode character does double duty, the 4-dot variant is a compromise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/slash.png"></td>
	<td>I am fond of Option 2, but it is so rare that the authenticity principle dictated Option 1 in this case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/1.png"></td>
	<td>A more understated design and far more common.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/2.png"></td>
	<td>Chosen as it appears less sharp and angular, better fitting with the other digits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/3.png"></td>
	<td>Option 2 is more legible and better distinguished from <u>8</u> and the Cyrillic letter <u>–ó</u>, but probably too rare to use here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/lt.png"></td>
	<td>The smaller less-than and greater-than signs are a better fit with both the other mathematical operators and conventional typefaces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/question.png"></td>
	<td>Option 3 lacks the point of inflection that I think question marks should have and Option 2 has a cramped upper curve, failing the sound design principle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/at.png"></td>
	<td>I like Option 2, but Option 1 is the more common design and looks better in the context of email addresses, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/A.png"></td>
	<td>Option 2 here (as with <u>D G</u> below) is more consistent with the other capitals and arguably a more sound design. I chose Option 1 to inject a little more quirkiness to the font.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/D.png"></td>
	<td>Reasons as noted for <u>A</u> above. Option 1 is also much more legible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/G.png"></td>
	<td>Reasons as noted for <u>A</u> above. Options 3 and 4 are perhaps a little too exaggerated for this font.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/J.png"></td>
	<td>Chosen for consistency with capital <u>I</u>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/N.png"></td>
	<td>Both have imperfect diagonals. I&rsquo;ve changed my mind on this one over the years, but at the moment Option 2 looks stranger to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/V.png"></td>
	<td>Less legible than Option 2, but chosen for consistency with <u>A</u> and <u>v</u>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/W.png"></td>
	<td>Also less legible than Option 2, but chosen for consistency with <u>V v w</u></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/Y.png"></td>
	<td>The more common design, which I also feel looks slightly nicer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/b.png"></td>
	<td>A tough decision. Option 3 matches option 2 of <u>h n r u</u>, which I don&rsquo;t like very much. Option 2 is the most well-designed; perhaps <u>too</u> well-designed for this font. Therefore, I chose Option 1 for being suitably quirky, yet functional.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/c.png"></td>
	<td>Although Options 2 and 3 are more legible, I prefer glyphs that are 5 dots wide and Option 2 is unattractive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/e.png"></td>
	<td>The shorter terminal makes the letter look clearer to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/f.png"></td>
	<td>Is 5 dots wide, more open and legible, more authentic, and the hook is consistent with <u>j t</u>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/h.png"></td>
	<td>I much prefer the look of option 1. It is also consistent with <u>b d</u> etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/j_lc.png"></td>
	<td>The hook is consistent with <u>f t</u> and the serif is consistent with <u>i</u>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/k.png"></td>
	<td>Is 5 dots wide and more open and legible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/m.png"></td>
	<td>This feels most natural to me and is a compromise between the other, equally common, options.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/r.png"></td>
	<td>Option 2 would match Option 2 of <u>b h</u> etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/t.png"></td>
	<td>Similar reasons as for <u>f</u>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/v_lc.png"></td>
	<td>Option 2 looks like the two sides are curved, rather than diagonal. Option 1 has straight sides but clear diagonals near the bottom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/w_lc.png"></td>
	<td>Chosen for consistency with <u>m</u>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/y_lc.png"></td>
	<td>Another tough decision. I like option 2 and its effect on the typographic colour of text in the font, but it is rather rare and other people don&rsquo;t seem to like it as much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/lbrace.png"></td>
	<td>Option 1 is highly exaggerated, but I find the others too hard to recognise as curly brackets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/pound.png"></td>
	<td>A more understated design that is more consistent with the rest of the font.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/yen.png"></td>
	<td>Same reasons as for the pound sign <u>&pound;</u> above.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/section.png"></td>
	<td>Chosen for consistency with the pilcrow/paragraph sign &para;.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/guillemets.png"></td>
	<td>Option 3 has no separation between the pair and Option 2 is too stylistic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/micro.png"></td>
	<td>A more traditional Greek shape, and unrelated to the design of <u>u</u> as it technically should be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/pilcrow.png"></td>
	<td>The longer version has better visual proportions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="research/options/eszett.png"></td>
	<td>I feel that Option 1 best suits the overall character of the font.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>With those more difficult choices made, here is the final design I arrived upon. In my view, it contains all of the best features from the many designs examined above and none of the worst:</p>

<figure class="font" style="max-width: 768px;">
	<img src="research/options/finaldesign.png" alt="Final design of Matrix Sans">
</figure>

<p>This may be the most effort anyone has ever put into a classic dot matrix-style font. I hope you find the result useful!</p>
