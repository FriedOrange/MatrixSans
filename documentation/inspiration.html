		<h2>Inspiration</h2>

		<!-- <p>For much of my life, I have liked both alphabets and lettering, and 8-bit home computers and video games. The intersection of those interests is low-resolution dot matrix graphics and fonts, which remain perhaps the most iconic feature of the 8-bit systems. Fonts based on a 5&times;7 dot matrix are especially noteworthy, having been some of the most common dimensions for over half a century.</p>

		<p>In utilitarian applications, 5&times;7 dot matrix fonts may still be found all around us, for example: in calculators, microwave ovens, electronic road signs, train stations and airport terminals, dot-matrix printers (which have mostly fallen out of use, but the style is still commonly seen in the expiry dates printed on food packaging) and "character LCD" modules used in all manner of electronic devices:</p> -->

		<p>Matrix Sans is based on the classic 5&times;7 dot matrix fonts that originated in the 20th century with punched card machines, dot-matrix printers, light-up signs at stadiums, etc. and early computers and video equipment. Such fonts still surround us in the 21st century‚Äîfor example: in LED displays of car radios and microwave ovens; VFDs in hi-fi and audiovisual equipment; electronic road signs and train station displays; flip-dot displays in buses and airports; LCDs in calculators and the &ldquo;character LCD&rdquo; modules found in all kinds of electronic equipment; and dot-matrix printers, which are still used to some extent, particularly for the expiry dates printed on food packaging.</p>

		<p>Nowadays, &ldquo;pixel&rdquo; style fonts like this are very popular, particularly as they evoke nostalgia for retro computers and video games. Most currently available free (and even commercial) fonts in this style are lacking in refinement and glyph coverage, though. Matrix Sans was conceived in 2019 to satisfy the need for a free, versatile and high-quality dot-matrix style font. Dozens of existing designs were studied in preparation; the goal for this project was to balance consistency and sound design with quirkiness and authenticity to its historic sources.</p>

		<!-- <p>So-called "pixel" fonts are also a popular stylistic choice, often seen in contexts that have nothing to do with electronics or games, even in the absence of technical limitations. With all of that in mind, I felt that the typographical world could be enriched through the creation of high-quality, open-source fonts in this style.</p> -->
